## Instructions (especially for big inputs and outputs)

Download the input file, run a solution `main` with an IntelliJ IDEA "run configuration",
and copy and run the command generated with the input and the output redirected in the terminal:

```shell
... < validation_input.txt > validation_output.txt
```

```shell
... < input.txt > output.txt
```
